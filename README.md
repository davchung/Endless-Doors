Greetings, reader of the README.md file. If you're here, you probably want to know more about the game Endless Doors.
Endless Doors is a role-playing game (RPG) built by Yuyi "Mark" Zhao, David Chung, Ethan Yeung, and Jonathan Ye as the
final project for Mr. Richard Hanson's AP Computer Science A class. It was programmed in the Java language using Eclipse
Photon, and the sprites came from https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii.


When the user first runs the program, a window with two characters, the Knight and Archer, shows up. Click on one option
to select a player.
A tutorial level then shows up. This level is intended to give the user an idea of what the game is about and allow the
user to experiment around with the controls.

The controls are as follows:
W A S D to move the character.
J to do main attack.
K to use special power.
O to deploy super secret weapon.
I to access the Inventory, or the Trading Post if near Trader.
? [or] / to view the Help Page.
P to pause/play the game.

For the Knight, the main attack is a short-ranged sword attack, and the special power is a shield.
For the Archer, the main attack is a long-ranged arrow attack, and the special power is a grappling device.

Following the tutorial level, the real game begins. Many aspects of the levels are randomly generated, but they do get
progressively harder as more levels are completed. In each level, an assortment of crates, barrels, chests, and walls
spawn, forming the 'environment.' In most levels, enemies spawn; each type of enemy has different abilities, but they
are all capable of dealing damage to the player.

Every 5th level or so, the Trader room will be generated. The Trading Post can be accessed by typing I when on the Trader.
The Trading Post is where gold coins collected throughout the game can be exchanged for weapons, which have varying attack
damages. These attack damages are added onto the player's attack damage when the weapon is purchased.
After every Trader room, the Boss room will be generated. Here, a formidable enemy (or multiple enemies) will spawn in a
wide-open room.

The Inventory page is where numerous details about the player can be viewed. It displays information such as amount of gold
coins, items in inventory, player health, and player attack damage.
The Help Page is where some information can be found about how to play the game.

Once all enemies in a level are defeated, a door will appear. Type J while on the door in order to move to the next level.
Chests contain gold coins and sometimes health potions.

The objective of the game is to beat as many levels as possible. The player loses there is no health left.

Good luck, and we hope you enjoy our game, Endless Doors!
